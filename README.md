A simple script to provide the relative path between two points of a file system.


                It supports paths from the same volume and alternate volumes.

Potential use in web development, if you are having a brain fart and can not work out the relative path off the top of your head.

If this is useful please like / fork and use.

Written in python 2, for python 3 use change raw_input to input and parse data to a string.

Released under miT license. No restriction although if this inspires you please provide me a credit.

With gratitide,

        Danny Kendall
